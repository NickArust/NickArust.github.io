<h2>Education</h2>
<ul>
  <li>UCF - PhD in Mathematics</li>
  <li>UF - B.S. in Mathematics, B.S. in Statistics, Minor in Electrical Engineering</li>
  <li>FAU High School - High School Diploma</li>
</ul>

<h2>Research Interests</h2>

My research focuses on applying and developing numerical algorithms for Inverse Problems. This involves working with Numerical PDEs, Numerical Integral Equations, and Numerical Analysis more broadly. I also apply and develop machine learning models to be used in conjunction with the numerical algorithms. Finally, I apply tools from signal processing and data science to boost efficiency and usability.
