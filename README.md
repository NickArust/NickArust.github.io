## Summary
I am a Ph.D student in Mathematics with a strong background in Scientific Computing and Machine Learning. My research focuses on developing numerical algorithms for problems and combining these tools with ML models to get better results, and I have a particular interest in Inverse Scattering Problems and Digital Twins. I am currently a Ph.D student in Mathematics at the University of Central Florida and am working under Dr. Carlos Borges.
