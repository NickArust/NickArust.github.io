Dear Hiring Committee,

I’m excited to apply for the Summer Research Program Internship with MIT Lincoln Laboratory’s Bioanalytics Systems and Technologies Group. As a PhD student in Applied and Computational Mathematics at the University of Central Florida, I’m passionate about developing advanced algorithms and workflows that turn complex datasets into actionable insights. The opportunity to work on bioinformatics challenges with your multidisciplinary team is particularly exciting, as it aligns perfectly with my academic background and research experiences.

While working in Dr. Hubert Wagner’s research group at the University of Florida, I developed an automated pipeline for analyzing neural network behavior using topological data analysis (TDA). This project, funded by a Google Research Scholar Award, bridged computational topology with machine learning model evaluation. By creating a novel descriptor to quantify how intermixed classes were in prediction spaces, I provided new insights into how classification models learn during training. The workflow automated data processing, leveraged Ripser for computational topology, and generated visualizations and statistics—reducing analysis time from hours to minutes. Presenting this work at the International Symposium of Computational Geometry 2024 was a rewarding experience that deepened my understanding of combining mathematical tools with real-world applications.

In my PhD work, I’ve built on this foundation by focusing on inverse problems and developing machine learning algorithms that work with large-scale datasets. One project involved creating a curriculum learning model to provide initial guesses for iterative solvers in acoustic inverse scattering problems. This work required not only deep theoretical understanding but also practical implementation skills, as I optimized the process to handle terabyte-scale datasets in a Linux environment. These experiences have sharpened my ability to design, test, and deploy algorithms tailored to complex, high-stakes problems—skills that I believe would translate well to the challenges your team addresses in biosecurity and health analytics.

What excites me most about this internship is the opportunity to contribute to the critical work of advancing bioinformatics tools and AI algorithms that impact national security and health. I am eager to collaborate with experts from diverse fields, explore new perspectives, and help develop solutions that make a tangible difference.

Thank you for considering my application. I’d love the opportunity to discuss how my background and skills can contribute to the mission of the Bioanalytics Systems and Technologies Group. I look forward to the chance to work with your team.

Best regards,
Nickolas Arustamyan
