<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Overview</strong>: I utilize Curriculum Learning models trained on multi-frequency data to generate initial guesses that are then fed into inverse problem solvers. These solvers utilize a Recursive Linearization architecture to converge to the true solution.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Results</strong>: Our results show comparable results to models not using Curriculum Learning, as expected. What is most interesting is that we are able to still get these results even when using less data, up to 50% less in some cases.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Technologies</strong>: MATLAB, Python, Tensorflow</p>

  <li>
    <p><strong>Overview</strong>: I developed an automated pipeline for analyzing mixed-up datasets using topological data analysis. The workflow automated taking point cloud data, analyzing it using the computational topology software Ripser, and generating comprehensive visualizations and statistics.  We applied the pipeline to understanding how classification models learn by investigating how the embeddings of their predictions separated over time.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Results</strong>: The results showcased that intuition matched expectations where less mixed up data was more easibly seperable and vice versa.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Technologies</strong>: Python, Pytorch, Ripser</li>
